"Continue guiding me through the 10 steps to make my FastAPI backend more robust, performant, and faster. I have already installed postgres"

1. Move to a Production-Ready Database
Switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL (or another robust RDBMS) for better concurrency, reliability, and scaling.
2. Use a Real Task Queue
Integrate Celery or RQ with a message broker (Redis/RabbitMQ) for background jobs.
This allows distributed processing, retries, and better resource management.
3. Add Caching
Cache results for repeated URLs (e.g., using Redis or a database table).
Avoid redundant downloads and processing.
4. Improve Error Handling & Retries
Add automatic retries for transient errors (network, temporary failures).
Implement notifications or logs for failed jobs.
5. Add Authentication & Rate Limiting
Use API keys, OAuth, or JWT for authentication.
Add rate limiting to prevent abuse (e.g., via FastAPI middleware or a proxy).
6. Use Cloud/Object Storage for Files
Store audio and stems in S3, GCS, or Azure Blob Storage instead of local disk.
This enables scaling, durability, and easier cleanup.
7. Add Monitoring & Logging
Use structured logging (e.g., with loguru or structlog).
Integrate with Prometheus/Grafana or another monitoring stack for metrics.
8. Resource Management
Limit concurrent jobs per user/IP.
Set max file size and timeout for processing.
9. Optimize Audio Processing
Profile and parallelize audio processing if possible.
Use faster libraries or hardware acceleration (GPU, if available).
10. Add Tests and CI/CD
Write unit and integration tests for endpoints and job logic.
Set up CI/CD for automated testing and deployment.
Suggested Next Steps
Choose a Task Queue: Decide on Celery or RQ, and set up Redis as a broker.
Refactor Background Processing: Move job processing to the task queue.
Switch to PostgreSQL: Update SQLAlchemy config and migrate schema.
Move Files to S3: Refactor file handling to use cloud storage.
Add Authentication: Implement API key or JWT-based auth.
Add Caching: Use Redis to cache processed results.
Add Monitoring: Integrate logging and metrics

"Guide me through verifying my Dockerized FastAPI backend deployment and completing the final robustness steps:

1. Verify all Docker containers are running with `docker-compose ps`.
2. Access the FastAPI docs at http://localhost:8000/docs and test the endpoints (including authentication if enabled).
3. Submit a job and confirm it is processed by the workers (check logs with `docker-compose logs -f`).
4. Scale workers as needed with `docker-compose up --scale worker=4 -d`.
5. Stop all services with `docker-compose down` when finished.
6. Add automated tests using pytest and FastAPI's TestClient.
7. Set up CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run tests and optionally build/deploy Docker images on push.
8. Ask for help with any troubleshooting, testing, or deployment questions."
